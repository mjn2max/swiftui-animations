## Usage

SwiftUI-Animations is designed for drop-in use with minimal configuration. Simply import the module and use the prebuilt animation components directly in your views:

**Example 1: Animated Loader**

```swift
import SwiftUI-Animations

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        BouncingDotsLoader()
            .frame(width: 100, height: 20)
    }
}
```

**Example 2: Customizable Transition**

```swift
import SwiftUI-Animations

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDetail = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if showDetail {
                DetailView()
                    .transition(.fadeAndSlide)
            }

            Button("Toggle") {
                withAnimation {
                    showDetail.toggle()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 3: Reusable Animation Modifier**

```swift
import SwiftUI-Animations

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Animated Text")
            .animatedScaleEffect()
    }
}
```
